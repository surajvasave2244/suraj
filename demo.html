    <p> <u>The best city in Maharashtra.</p> </u>
    <h3> <b>Mumbai</b> </h3>
    <p> <i>Mumbai (formerly called Bombay) is a densely populated city on India’s west coast. 
        A financial center, it's India's largest city. <br>
         On the Mumbai Harbour waterfront stands the iconic Gateway of India stone arch, built by the British Raj in 1924.
          Offshore, nearby Elephanta Island holds ancient  <br>cave temples dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. 
          The city's also famous as the heart of the Bollywood film industry.</p> </i>

    <p>The seven islands that came to constitute Mumbai were home to communities of fishing colonies of the Koli people. <br>
         For centuries, the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire and <br>
        subsequently to the East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza and as part of <br>
        her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by <br>
        the Hornby Vellard project, which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea. <br>
        Along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, <br>transformed Bombay into a major <br>
        seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. 
        During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India’s independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. <br>
        In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital</p>
